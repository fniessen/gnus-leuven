** Gnus for Google Inbox

Recently, I’ve been using Google Inbox. Since I have previously setup my Google
account to send and receive mail from my other email accounts, I can use it as
my primary email service for all of my mail. While Google Inbox isn’t really
“revolutionary”, it re-evaluates which UI elements of an email client should be
emphasized. Instead of heavily emphasizing folders, categorization, flagging,
etc., Inbox values the message list, and your basic activities are: read, act,
and done. You read the message easily. Then you act on the message. That may
mean actually dealing with it, or it may mean snoozing it. Once you’ve dealt
with the message, you hit “Done” and it goes away from your inbox. But, it’s
never gone for good, and you can always get back to old messages with a simple
search.
